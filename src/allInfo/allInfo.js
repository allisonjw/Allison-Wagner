    description:
      "To me, life is a University full of knowledge. My interest in software development is sparked by my zest for learning, being naturally curious and fascinated with new technology. I have over 20+ years in customer service, management, project planning, problem solving and strategic thinking. I loved my career, being able to take a problem, analyze it and find a solution for my customer. But itâ€™s never too late if life to take a chance to find your personal success. I will bring my understanding of the customer as well as my excellent interpersonal skills to the developer world. To my future employer, I can help deliver a product that is accessible, effective, beautiful and easy for your customer to understand.",
